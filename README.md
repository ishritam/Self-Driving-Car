# Self-Driving-Car
We are here building a minimal version of self driving car. Here, we have a front camera view. This will transfer input to the computer. Then Deep Learning algorithm in computer predicts the steering angle to avoid all sorts of collisions. Predicting steering angle can be thought of as a regression problem. We will feed images to Convolutional Neural Network and the label will be the steering angle in that image. Model will learn the steering angle from the as per the turns in the image and will finally predicts steering angle for unknown images.
